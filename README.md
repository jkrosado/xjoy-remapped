# xjoy remapped
xjoy, with right joycon layout remapped to the standard nintendo layout

## what's the difference?
xjoy uses the xbox button layout, which causes buttons like the A button to act like B, B to act like A, and so on. if you don't play xbox, or are used to the standard nintendo button layout, this will use that layout.
